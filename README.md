# DeepLearning-ModelOptimization
 Optimazing a deep learning model in Python.
 By exploring on our own, we successfully achieved a better accuracy for cifar10:
 We tuned the optimization algorithm (SGD with momentum and Adam) and the learning rate,
 added batch normalization and added regularization.

Final Project - CIFAR10 Image Classification
This is the final project for the deep learning course, where the goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset. The project builds on the knowledge and skills learned throughout the course, with a focus on tuning hyperparameters and exploring innovative ideas for improving network performance.

# Dataset
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

# Project Description
 In this project, we will be tuning various hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of our neural network on the CIFAR10 dataset. We will also be reading relevant   materials and summarizing innovative ideas to incorporate into our network.

 The notebook provides instructions on which hyperparameters to tune, but we are encouraged to explore additional hyperparameters to achieve the best performance. We will use a portion of the data to speed up training, but the dataset size we test on should still be large (at least 12,000 training images and 3,000 validation images).

 We can run experiments from several notebooks and save the output files in the results dictionary. We should choose meaningful names for our output files and use 'plot_exp_results' to plot them. We may want to use loops to automatically run each section's experiments.

 We will submit this notebook, all relevant python files, and a report summarizing our attempts and results. In the report, we should describe the hyperparameters we used, how we chose them, and how they affected our results.

# Conclusion
In summary, this project provides an opportunity to apply the deep learning knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course. By tuning hyperparameters and incorporating innovative ideas, we aim to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset. Good luck!
