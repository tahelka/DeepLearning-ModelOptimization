# DeepLearning-ModelOptimization
This is the final project for the deep learning course in Python, where the goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset. The project builds on the knowledge and skills learned throughout the course: we tuned the optimization algorithm (using SGD with momentum and Adam) and the learning rate, added batch normalization and added regularization.

# Dataset
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

# Project Description
In this project, we tuned various hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of our neural network on the CIFAR10 dataset. We also read relevant materials and summarized to have a better knowledge in deep learning.

The notebook provided instructions on which hyperparameters to tune, but we were encouraged to explore additional hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
We submited this notebook, all relevant python files, and a report summarizing our attempts and results. In the report, we described the hyperparameters we used, how we chose them, and how they affected our results.

# Conclusion
In summary, this project provided an opportunity to apply the deep learning knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course. By tuning hyperparameters and other optimizations which were mentioned above, we aimed to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset.
