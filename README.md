# DeepLearning-ModelOptimization
 Optimazing a deep learning model in Python.
 
 By exploring on our own, we successfully achieved a better accuracy for cifar10:
 
 We tuned the optimization algorithm (SGD with momentum and Adam) and the learning rate,
 
 added batch normalization and added regularization.
