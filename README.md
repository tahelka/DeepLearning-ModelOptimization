# DeepLearning-ModelOptimization
Final Project - CIFAR10 Image Classification
This is the final project for the deep learning course in Python, where the goal is to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset. The project builds on the knowledge and skills learned throughout the course: we tuned the optimization algorithm (SGD with momentum and Adam) and the learning rate, added batch normalization and added regularization.

# Dataset
The CIFAR10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The dataset is divided into 50,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

# Project Description
 In this project, we will be tuning various hyperparameters to improve the accuracy of our neural network on the CIFAR10 dataset. We will also be reading relevant   materials and summarizing to have a better knowledge in deep learning.

 The notebook provides instructions on which hyperparameters to tune, but we are encouraged to explore additional hyperparameters to achieve the best performance.
 We submited this notebook, all relevant python files, and a report summarizing our attempts and results. In the report, we described the hyperparameters we used, how we chose them, and how they affected our results.

# Conclusion
In summary, this project provides an opportunity to apply the deep learning knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course. By tuning hyperparameters and incorporating innovative ideas, we aim to achieve the highest accuracy possible on the CIFAR10 image classification dataset.
